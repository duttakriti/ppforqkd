Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Simulation and Post-Processing
This repository contains Python and Arduino driver codes for simulating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and implementing post-processing algorithms.

Repository Structure
Python Codes:

Simulates QKD protocols and post-processing algorithms like error correction and privacy amplification.
Arduino Codes:

Main Branch (Mega): Post-processing algorithms for Arduino Mega.
Giga Branch (Giga): Optimized algorithms for Arduino Giga.
Note: Quantum setup codes are excluded due to confidentiality (Fraunhofer IPMS collaboration).
